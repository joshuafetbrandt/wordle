# wordle

Wordle is such a lovely game. If you haven't played it, totally go play it. The big idea for standard Wordle is to guess a 5 letter word in 6 guesses or less. After every word you guess, you get feedback that falls into one of 3 categories:

1. The letter is not in the word.
2. The letter is in the word but not in the guessed position.
3. The letter is in the word and is in the guessed position.

I have played this game for a while, and I always wondered if there was a "best" starting word. Prior to starting this project, my favorite starting word was "AFTER", but I had nothing to tell me that it was "best" other than annecdote. Understanding this best starting word became the motivating factor for this short project. 

Everything in this project is built on the nltk corpus of words (from nltk.corpus import words). I learned a few things that are documented in the code files, but I will highlight the two big things I learned about nltk during this process:

1. The list of words generated by 'from nltk.corpus import words' contains names (e.g., like 'Josh' or 'Emily'). 
2. The list of words generated by 'from nltk.corpus import words' does not contain all words (e.g., 'HAPPIER' is in the list, but 'HAPPY' is not). Lemmatizing/Stemming may help address this a little, but then you would need a way to acquire all similar words, which is something I didn't want to work through quite yet.
